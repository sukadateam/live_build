Discord Server: Message Me If You Wish To Help. Thank You!
<br>A custom database handler. Still in development.

To setup. Install all items in requirements.txt using pip and run custom_database.py. That's it!
<br>pip install -r requirements.txt

<br>Please note: macOS and Linux support is nearly done. If you notice any problems please make a report.
<br><br>Nerdy Stuff:<br>For the absolute latest version download the source code. Not in releases. May cause issues. It won't always be tested before updated. Do not do this if you are looking for a stable version.

<br>Latest Notes:<br>1. macOS, Windows, Linux, and PyDroid all support this app.
<br>2. Updates are being released at a rapid pace. Some builds may not be usuable. If so, use a previous version.
